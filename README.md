# Automated Birthday Email Sender

This Python project automates the process of sending personalized birthday wishes via email using the `smtplib` library. The script reads a list of contacts with their birthdays and email addresses from a CSV file, and sends them a unique birthday message on their special day. The `pandas` library is used to efficiently manage and manipulate the contact data.
